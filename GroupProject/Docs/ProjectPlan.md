# Project Plan

**Author**: Team 12

## 1 Introduction

This app allows users to sign-in, create vocabulary quizzes, practice vocabulary quizzes which other students create, and view quiz statistics.

## 2 Process Description
Note that although the activities are described as a list, we will employ a spiral software development process.  We may only have time for 2 iterations in the short development process allotted for this particular project.

- Specification:  
  1. Activity description - Do a requirements analysis and define what the app should do
  2. Entrance criteria - For this assignment, we not only need the assignment instructions, but to assess the functional and non-functional requirements as well as user and system requirements
  3. Exit Criteria - A software specification requirement (SRS) document

- Design:   
  1. Activity description - Define user stories, app objects and activities, relationships between classes, and the interface
  2. Entrance criteria - Requirement Specifications (including the system structure, software specification, interface specification, component specification and data description)
  3. Exit criteria - We will develop user stories, an architectural design document, class diagram or component design, interface design document, and test plan

- Implementation:
  1. Activity description - Build the software (code) according to the specifications and design
  2. Entrance criteria - Specification and design documents
  3. Exit criteria - A working prototype of the software and updated documents

- Verification and Validation:
  1. Activity description - Verify the software meets the requirements and complete unit, component, and system testing
  2. Entrance criteria - Requirements specification and a prototype of the software
  3. Exit criteria - Production version of software, Results from the test cases, and Updated documents
